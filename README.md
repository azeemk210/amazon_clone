A simple Amazon clone website built with HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome for the icons. This project replicates the basic structure and appearance of Amazon's homepage, including the logo, search bar, navigation links, and account/cart icons and many more.

## Project Structure

```
amazon-clone/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file for the website
├── style.css           # CSS file for styling
├── images/

└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Features

- **Responsive Navbar**: A header with Amazon-like navbar featuring a logo, search bar, and navigation icons.
- **Search Bar**: Simulated search input for user queries.
- **Account and Cart Icons**: Includes Font Awesome icons to mimic Amazon's account and cart sections.
- **Navigation Links**: Links to common Amazon categories like "Today's Deals," "Customer Service," etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your computer:
- A code editor (such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- A web browser to view the project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-clone.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd amazon-clone
   ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser to view the project.

### File Setup

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
- **style.css**: Holds all CSS styling for the navbar and other elements.
- **images/amazon_logo.png**: Ensure that this file exists in the `images` folder, as it’s referenced in the CSS for the logo display.

## Usage

1. **Run the HTML File**: Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. **Explore the Navbar**: The navbar includes a placeholder logo, search bar, and navigation icons.
3. **Customize the Project**: Modify the HTML and CSS files to expand on this layout or make changes as needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Logo Not Displaying**: Make sure the path to `amazon_logo.png` in `style.css` is correct. The default path assumes the image is located in the `images` folder within the main project directory.

## Technologies Used
